<h3> Bio </h3>
<p> My name is Julien Nelson and I moved to San Francisco, CA from Jersey City, NJ in order to pursue a career in the tech industry and acquire all of the opportunities that San Francisco has to offer. I am a young Haitian American and Salvadorian American born in New York City I moved to New Jersey because of living preference for my mother.Growing up I had an abnormal childhood with moving from middle class in private schools down to a lower socioeconomic class and attending public schools. This down fall started with my parents splitting up after many arguments. This greatly affected my emotions and behavior but luckily I still had friends to fall back on. With distractions like TV, Friends, Movies, and Video Games I was able to enjoy my childhood instead of suffering in depression. Specifically Video Games, was my passion due to the enjoyment of playing with my Friends. This Passion of Gaming led me to consider moving to San Francisco for college, but instead my mom suggested to move for High School, which was an idea I decided to roll with. Now i'm attending John O'Connell High School with a 3.59 GPA, Vice president of the Senior Class, and Alumni of the Facebook Summer Academy Internship. </p>
